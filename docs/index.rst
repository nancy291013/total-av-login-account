What is a Total AV Login Account?
---------------------------------

A Total AV login account is essentially your personal access point to Total AV’s suite of security services. When you create this account, you establish a unique identity within the Total AV system. This allows you to manage your subscriptions, download the software on various devices, update your security settings, and receive real-time alerts about potential threats.

Instead of treating antivirus protection as a standalone service installed on one device, Total AV uses this account to create a seamless, integrated experience across multiple platforms. By logging in, you gain control over your digital safety in a centralized and user-friendly manner.
